# raspberrypi-BadUSB
This is basically just USB Rubber Ducky made specifically to run via CLI on linux (kali to be specific), it uses whiptail for graphical part, I also modified original duckpi.sh script for standard Windows Czech QWERTZ keyboard layout. It behaves similary to USB Rubber Ducky - device acting as keyboard that types faster, than any human would. This makes it good for automating tasks, pranks, pentesting and much more. Original Ducky scripts should work without a problem, but they must use .txt file extension. This script should be compatible with different devices, like Android phones etc...

I will add some setup tutorial soon, but the code should work as is, but raspberry pi needs to be configured to act as g_hid. The Rpi_BadUSB file needs to be put to /home/kali to work correctly, otherwise you need to change path!
